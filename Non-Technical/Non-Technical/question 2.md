Statement of Purpose

I am currently in my second year of undergraduate  and am deeply motivated to join the Artificial Intelligence Community to further immerse myself in the field of AI/ML and grow through collaboration, mentorship, and hands-on experience.

During my first year, I had limited exposure to machine learning and artificial intelligence. However, over the summer break, I took the initiative to explore the field by enrolling in several introductory courses, including Andrew Ngâ€™s well-known Machine Learning course. This marked a turning point for me. My longstanding interest in calculus and probability found a meaningful application in understanding how AI systems function. Since then, my curiosity has only grown stronger.

In my second year, I have actively pursued this interest by working on multiple AI/ML-related projects and participating in initiatives like the Winter in Data Science program. These experiences have helped me develop foundational skills and deepened my interest in solving real-world problems using data-driven approaches. I also participated in the Smart India Hackathon (SIH), where our team qualified the institute round. Although our idea did not make it past the PPT stage, the experience taught me the value of collaboration and structured problem-solving.

My long-term goal is to build a career in the AI/ML domain. I believe being part of the Artificial Intelligence Community will provide me with the right environment to enhance my technical abilities, learn from like-minded peers, and contribute to meaningful projects. I am particularly eager to participate in more hackathons and research initiatives, and I feel that being part of a dedicated and experienced team will help me take my learning to the next level.

In return, I am committed to contributing to the community through consistent participation, sharing my learnings from past projects, and actively collaborating on new ideas. I look forward to engaging with others, both as a learner and a contributor, and to being part of a vibrant ecosystem that pushes the boundaries of what AI can achieve.
