Problem selection and quantitative formulation.

* The first step is deciding what to solve .I along with my team will brainstorm on the topics that are aligned with current challenges that are not solved or not solved very effectively. It should be innovative, unique and impactful.  
* We will search for all the solutions that already exist for that problem and there loopholes that we can fix.  
* Most importantly it should be feasible and the dataset should be widely available. We’d look for something that is data-rich and has clear measurable outcomes.  
* After selecting 2-3 ideas we need to figure out what are the inputs what will be output what kind of ML task it is and according to that what will be its evaluating method.


Data sourcing and preprocessing techniques.

* We will  reading articles, research papers, news stories, or relevant blogs related to  selected problem. This helps us to understand real-world context, common challenges, and the kind of data that might be valuable.  
* Once we're familiar with the space we should begin sourcing data. Open-source platforms like Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, government portals (like data.gov), or academic datasets . Datasets should be from credible or official sources to ensure reliability. If the data we need isn’t publicly available, consider conducting a small-scale survey or collecting data manually to build a representative sample.  
* After collecting the data, for preprocessing Handling missing values,Removing duplicates or irrelevant entries,Data type conversion Feature encoding, Normalization/Scaling, Outlier detection, Text preprocessing for nlp task, .Image preprocessing for computer vision task should be done


Exploratory Data Analysis.

* Now comes analysis of the data collected  to understand patterns, correlations, and outliers. Visualization tools like Seaborn and Plotly help here.   
* We will start summarizing the main characteristics of the dataset using statistical measures like mean, median, standard deviation, and distribution plots.  
* Our exploration, might uncover new insights that were not obvious earlier, documenting these findings and, if needed, revisit  preprocessing steps or modifying model’s input features accordingly.  
* Assess the balance of the dataset especially if it's a classification task. If the classes are imbalanced,We have to plan techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or using weighted loss functions during training.

Model selection, training strategies, compute requirements.

* Starting  by identifying the type of problem we're solving. The nature of the problem determines which models are likely to perform best.  
* Trying out multiple models and compare their performance using validation techniques. Tools like ChatGPT or AutoML can even help us analyze our dataset and suggest appropriate models based on our objectives. The goal is to find a model that offers the best trade-off between accuracy, interpretability, training time, and scalability.  
    
* Once a model is chosen, focus on training strategies. Splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets then doing Hyperparameter tuning, Applying regularization techniques, then checking for overfitting underfitting.

* More complex models like, or deep learning models may require GPUs or cloud computing platforms like Google Colab, Kaggle Kernels, AWS, or Azure. It's important to match our model's computational needs with available resources to avoid slowdowns or crashes during training.

Team roles, milestones, deliverables, risk mitigation.

* Team members should be divided in th roles based on each member’s strengths, one person can focus on data collection and cleaning, another on model building, someone else on visualization and documentation, and another on testing and deployment.  
     
* We should set milestones at each stage of our project. For example, if our goal is to achieve 80% accuracy, that becomes one of our key milestones. Once we reach it,save our model, and, if time and resources permit, aim for an even higher target like 90%. It's very important for us to regularly save our progress and working models. That way, if any new changes introduce issues or lower performance, we can easily go back to the last stable version.  
* We should always keep backups of our data, code, and models. While experimenting with new ideas, we must avoid deleting our working models. Instead, we can build new versions separately so that our stable model remains safe. This helps us avoid losing all our progress if something goes wrong.  
* Our deliverables are the final outcomes of our efforts what we present to the judges or share with the community. This includes our trained model, a short report or presentation explaining our solution, meaningful visualizations, and the overall impact or usefulness of our idea.   
* We need to document all our research on the topic and keep it readily available during the judging, so we’re well-prepared to answer any questions from the judges.
